# specialty-coffee-recipes-skills

A portable skill package for specialty coffee workflows. The main skill, `coffee-recipe-generator`, helps an agent analyze coffee bag details, generate brewing recipes, adapt recipes across beans or brewers, and research brewing techniques from primary sources.

## How the Skill Works

The skill lives in `coffee-recipe-generator/SKILL.md`. It defines four workflows:

- **Bag Analysis:** extracts details from a coffee bag image and formats them with `templates/coffee-profile.md`.
- **Recipe Generation:** builds a brew recipe from method, dose, origin, and processing method.
- **Recipe Adaptation:** adjusts an existing recipe for a different bean, brewer, filter, or flavor goal.
- **Primary-Source Research:** summarizes brewing science, equipment guidance, or competition techniques with exact source URLs.

The skill is storage-optional. It can read and write profiles or recipes if a host system provides storage, but it must also work from inline chat inputs and return Markdown directly.

## Repository Layout

- `coffee-recipe-generator/SKILL.md`: primary workflow rules and required behavior
- `coffee-recipe-generator/templates/`: Markdown scaffolds for profiles and recipes
- `coffee-recipe-generator/references/`: brewing defaults, grinder ranges, origin guidance, troubleshooting, equipment notes, and research sources
- `coffee-recipe-generator/scripts/`: reusable validation scripts for skill outputs
- `.codex/hooks.json`: Codex hook wiring for repository-local validation
- `AGENTS.md`: contributor guidance for maintaining this repository

## How to Use It

Load `coffee-recipe-generator` when the user asks for coffee bag analysis, recipe generation, recipe tuning, recipe adaptation, or brewing research.

For recipe generation, collect these required inputs:

- Brew method, such as V60, AeroPress, Orea, Chemex, French Press, or 4:6
- Coffee dose in grams
- Coffee origin
- Processing method, such as washed, natural, or honey
- Flavor intent: clarity, balanced, sweetness, body, or forgiveness

Optional inputs improve accuracy: roast level, variety, elevation, strength preference, available brewer, and grinder model.

Every generated or adapted recipe must include a grinder table with these five rows: `1Zpresso K-Ultra`, `1Zpresso Q Air`, `Baratza Encore ESP`, `Fellow Opus`, and `Timemore C2`. Use `references/grinder-settings.md` and `references/grind-determinants.md` instead of estimating from generic grind labels.

## Output Expectations

Recipes should follow `templates/recipe-output.md` and include:

- Coffee Details
- Overview
- Flavor Profile
- Brew Timeline
- Brewing Steps
- Troubleshooting Guide
- Adjusting for Your Taste

Coffee profiles should follow `templates/coffee-profile.md`. If no storage destination is configured, return the finished profile or recipe inline as Markdown.

When this repository's Codex hooks are trusted, the `Stop` hook runs `coffee-recipe-generator/scripts/validate-recipe-output.py` to request a correction pass if a generated recipe omits required sections or any of the five grinder rows.

## Troubleshooting

Use `references/troubleshooting.md` when adjusting a recipe after tasting.

- Sour or under-extracted: grind 1-2 clicks finer, raise temperature 1-2 C, or pour more slowly.
- Bitter or over-extracted: grind 1-2 clicks coarser, lower temperature 1-2 C, or pour faster.
- Weak or watery: grind finer, use more coffee, or slow the first pour.
- Too strong: grind coarser, use less coffee, or dilute after brewing.
- Muddy or cloudy: reduce agitation, pour more gently, or allow the bed to settle.

If a coffee bag image is unreadable, ask for a clearer photo rather than guessing missing fields. If origin or processing method is missing for recipe generation, ask for it before generating the recipe.

## Maintenance Notes

Keep references and templates plain Markdown so they can work in chat, local files, Obsidian, Notion, and GitHub. When adding a new brewing rule, update the relevant file in `references/` and ensure `SKILL.md` points to it if the workflow depends on it.
